# Where Have the Kaczmarz Iterates gone?

This repository is the official implementation of the numerical results presented in The Paper _Where Have the Kaczmarz Iterates gone?_ 

## Requirements
We conducted the experiments using python 3.8.5, pandas 1.1.3, numpy 1.19.2, and scipy 1.8.0. The numerical results can be easily reproduced by running the provided Jupyter notebooks available in the repository.
